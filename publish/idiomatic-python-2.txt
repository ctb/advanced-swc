Idiomatic Python revisited
==========================

sets
----

Sets recently (2.4?) migrated from a stdlib component into a default type.
They're exactly what you think: unordered collections of values.

>>> s = set((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
>>> t = set((4, 5, 6))
>>> print s
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

You can union and intersect them:

>>> print s.union(t)
set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
>>> print s.intersection(t)
set([4, 5])

And you can also check for supersets and subsets:

>>> u = set((4, 5, 6, 7))
>>> print t.issubset(u)
True
>>> print u.issubset(t)
False

One more note: you can convert between sets and lists pretty easily:

>>> sl = list(s)
>>> ss = set(sl)

``any`` and ``all``
-------------------

``all`` and ``any`` are two new functions in Python that work with iterables
(e.g. lists, generators, etc.).  ``any`` returns True if *any* element of
the iterable is True (and False otherwise); ``all`` returns True if *all*
elements of the iterable are True (and False otherwise).

Consider:

>>> x = [ True, False ]
>>> print any(x)
True
>>> print all(x)
False

>>> y = [ True, True ]
>>> print any(x)
True
>>> print all(x)
False

>>> z = [ False, False ]
>>> print any(z)
False
>>> print all(z)
False

Exceptions and exception hierarchies
------------------------------------

You're all familiar with exception handling using try/except:

>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> x[10]
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
IndexError: list index out of range

You can catch all exceptions quite easily:

>>> try:
...   y = x[10]
... except:
...   y = None

but this is considered bad form, because of the potential for over-broad
exception handling:

>>> try:
...   y = x["10"]
... except:
...   y = None

In general, try to catch the exception most specific to your code:

>>> try:
...   y = x[10]
... except IndexError:
...   y = None

...because then you will see the errors you didn't plan for:

>>> try:
...   y = x["10"]
... except IndexError:
...   y = None
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
TypeError: list indices must be integers

Incidentally, you can re-raise exceptions, potentially after doing
something else:

>>> try:
...   y = x[10]
... except IndexError:
...   # do something else here #
...   raise
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
IndexError: list index out of range

There are some special exceptions to be aware of.  Two that I run into a lot
are SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt.  KeyboardInterrupt is what is raised
when a CTRL-C interrupts Python; you can handle it and exit gracefully if
you like, e.g.

>>> try:
...   # do_some_long_running_task()
...   pass
... except KeyboardInterrupt:
...   sys.exit(0)

which is sometimes nice for things like Web servers (more on that tomorrow).

SystemExit is also pretty useful.  It's actually an exception raised by
``sys.exit``, i.e.

>>> import sys
>>> try:
...   sys.exit(0)
... except SystemExit:
...   pass

means that sys.exit has no effect!  You can also raise SystemExit instead
of calling sys.exit, e.g.

>>> raise SystemExit(0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
SystemExit: 0

is equivalent to ``sys.exit(0)``:

>>> sys.exit(0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
SystemExit: 0

Another nice feature of exceptions is exception hierarchies.
Exceptions are just classes that derive from ``Exception``, and you
can catch exceptions based on their base classes.  So, for example,
you can catch most standard errors by catching the StandardError
exception, from which e.g. IndexError inherits:

>>> print issubclass(IndexError, StandardError)
True

>>> try:
...   y = x[10]
... except StandardError:
...   y = None

You can also catch some exceptions more specifically than others.  For
example, KeyboardInterrupt inherits from Exception, and some times you
want to catch KeyboardInterrupts while ignoring all other exceptions:

>>> try:
...   # ...
...   pass
... except KeyboardInterrupt:
...   raise
... except Exception:
...   pass

Note that if you want to print out the error, you can do coerce a string
out of the exception to present to the user:

>>> try:
...   y = x[10]
... except Exception, e:
...   print 'CAUGHT EXCEPTION!', str(e)
CAUGHT EXCEPTION! list index out of range

Last but not least, you can define your own exceptions and exception
hierarchies:

>>> class MyFavoriteException(Exception):
...   pass
>>> raise MyFavoriteException
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
MyFavoriteException

I haven't used this much myself, but it is invaluable when you are writing
packages that have a lot of different detailed exceptions that you might
want to let users handle.

(By default, I usually raise a simple Exception in my own code.)

Oh, one more note: AssertionError.  Remember assert?

>>> assert 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
AssertionError

Yep, it raises an AssertionError that you can catch, if you REALLY want to...

Function Decorators
--------------------

Function decorators are a strange beast that I tend to use only in my
testing code and not in my actual application code.  Briefly, function
decorators are functions that take functions as arguments, and return
other functions.  Confused?  Let's see a simple example that makes
sure that no keyword argument named 'something' ever gets passed into
a function:

>>> def my_decorator(fn):
...
...   def new_fn(*args, **kwargs):
...      if 'something' in kwargs:
...         print 'REMOVING', kwargs['something']
...         del kwargs['something']
...      return fn(*args, **kwargs)
...
...   return new_fn

To apply this decorator, use this funny @ syntax:

>>> @my_decorator
... def some_function(a=5, b=6, something=None, c=7):
...   print a, b, something, c

OK, now ``some_function`` has been invisibly replaced with the result of
``my_decorator``, which is going to be ``new_fn``.  Let's see the result:

>>> some_function(something='MADE IT')
REMOVING MADE IT
5 6 None 7

Mind you, without the decorator, the function does exactly what you expect:

>>> def some_function(a=5, b=6, something=None, c=7):
...   print a, b, something, c
>>> some_function(something='MADE IT')
5 6 MADE IT 7

OK, so this is a bit weird.  What possible uses are there for this??

Here are three example uses:

First, synchronized functions like in Java.  Suppose you had a bunch
of functions (f1, f2, f3...) that could not be called concurrently, so
you wanted to play locks around them.  You could do this with decorators:

>>> import threading
>>> def synchronized(fn):
...   lock = threading.Lock()
...
...   def new_fn(*args, **kwargs):
...      lock.acquire()
...      print 'lock acquired'
...      result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
...      lock.release()
...      print 'lock released'
...      return result
...
...   return new_fn

and then when you define your functions, they will be locked:

>>> @synchronized
... def f1():
...   print 'in f1'
>>> f1()
lock acquired
in f1
lock released

Second, adding attributes to functions.  (This is why I use them in my testing
code sometimes.)  

>>> def attrs(**kwds):
...    def decorate(f):
...        for k in kwds:
...            setattr(f, k, kwds[k])
...        return f
...    return decorate

>>> @attrs(versionadded="2.2",
...       author="Guido van Rossum")
... def mymethod(f):
...    pass

>>> print mymethod.versionadded
2.2
>>> print mymethod.author
Guido van Rossum

Third, memoize/caching of results.  Here's a really simple example; you can
find much more general ones online, in particular on the `Python Cookbook
site <http://www.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/>`__.

Imagine that you have a CPU-expensive one-parameter function:

>>> def expensive(n):
...   print 'IN EXPENSIVE', n
...   # do something expensive here, like calculate n'th prime

You could write a caching decorator to wrap this function and record
results transparently:

>>> def simple_cache(fn):
...   cache = {}
...
...   def new_fn(n):
...      if n in cache:
...         print 'FOUND IN CACHE; RETURNING'
...         return cache[n]
...
...      # otherwise, call function & record value
...      val = fn(n)
...      cache[n] = val
...      return val
...
...   return new_fn

Then use this as a decorator to wrap the expensive function:

>>> @simple_cache
... def expensive(n):
...   print 'IN THE EXPENSIVE FN:', n
...   return n**2

Now, when you call this function twice with the same argument, if will
only do the calculation once; the second time, the function call will be
intercepted and the cached value will be returned.

>>> expensive(55)
IN THE EXPENSIVE FN: 55
3025
>>> expensive(55)
FOUND IN CACHE; RETURNING
3025

try/finally
-----------

Finally, we come to try/finally!

The syntax of try/finally is just like try/except: ::

    try:
       do_something()
    finally:
       do_something_else()

The purpose of try/finally is to ensure that something is done, whether or
not an exception is raised:

>>> x = [0, 1, 2]
>>> try:
...   y = x[5]
... finally:
...   x.append('something')
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
IndexError: list index out of range

>>> print x
[0, 1, 2, 'something']

(It's actually semantically equivalent to:

>>> try:
...   y = x[5]
... except IndexError:
...   x.append('something')
...   raise
Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
IndexError: list index out of range

but it's a bit cleaner, because the exception doesn't have to be re-raised
and you don't have to catch a specific exception type.)

Well, why do you need this?  Let's think about locking.  First, get a lock:

>>> import threading
>>> lock = threading.Lock()

Now, if you're locking something, you want to be darn sure to *release*
that lock.  But what if an exception is raised right in the middle?

>>> def fn():
...    print 'acquiring lock'
...    lock.acquire()
...    y = x[5]
...    print 'releasing lock'
...    lock.release()
>>> try:
...    fn()
... except IndexError:
...   pass
acquiring lock

Note that 'releasing lock' is never printed: 'lock' is now left in a
locked state, and next time you run 'fn' you will hang the program
forever.  Oops.

You can fix this with try/finally:

>>> lock = threading.Lock()		# gotta trash the previous lock, or hang!
>>> def fn():
...    print 'acquiring lock'
...    lock.acquire()
...    try:
...       y = x[5]
...    finally:
...       print 'releasing lock'
...       lock.release()
>>> try:
...   fn()
... except IndexError:
...   pass
acquiring lock
releasing lock

Function arguments, and wrapping functions
------------------------------------------

You may have noticed above (in the section on decorators) that we wrapped
functions using this notation: ::

   def wrapper_fn(*args, **kwargs):
       return fn(*args, **kwargs)

(This takes the place of the old 'apply'.)  What does this do?

Here, \*args assigns all of the positional arguments to a tuple
'args', and '\*\*kwargs' assigns all of the keyword arguments to a
dictionary 'kwargs':

>>> def print_me(*args, **kwargs):
...   print 'args is:', args
...   print 'kwargs is:', kwargs

>>> print_me(5, 6, 7, test='me', arg2=None)
args is: (5, 6, 7)
kwargs is: {'test': 'me', 'arg2': None}

When a function is called with this notation, the args and kwargs are
unpacked appropriately and passed into the function.  For example,
the function ``test_call``

>>> def test_call(a, b, c, x=1, y=2, z=3):
...   print a, b, c, x, y, z

can be called with a tuple of three args (matching 'a', 'b', 'c'):

>>> tuple_in = (5, 6, 7)
>>> test_call(*tuple_in)
5 6 7 1 2 3

with some optional keyword args:

>>> d = { 'x' : 'hello', 'y' : 'world' }
>>> test_call(*tuple_in, **d)
5 6 7 hello world 3

Incidentally, this lets you implement the 'dict' constructor in one
line!

>>> def dict_replacement(**kwargs):
...    return kwargs
