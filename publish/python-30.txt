Python 3.0
==========

What's coming in Python 3000 (a.k.a. Python 3.0)?

First of all, Python 3000 will be out sometime in 2008; large parts of
it have already been implemented.  It is simply an increment on the
current code base.

The biggest point is that Python 3000 will break backwards
compatibility, abruptly.  This is very unusual for Python, but is
necessary to get rid of some old cruft.  In general, Python has been
very good about updating slowly and incrementally without breaking
backwards compatibility very much; this approach is being abandoned
for the jump from 2.x to 3.x.

However, the actual impact of this is likely to be small.  There will
be a few expressions that no longer work -- for example, 'dict.has_key'
is being removed, because you can just do 'if key in dict' -- but a
lot of the changes are behind the scenes, e.g. functions that currently
return lists will return iterators (dict.iterkeys -> dict.keys).

The biggest impact on this audience (scientists & numerical people) is
probably that (in Python 3.0) 6 / 5 will no longer be 0, and <> is
being removed.

Where lots of existing code must be made Python 3k compatible, you will
be able to use an automated conversion tool.  This should "just work"
except for cases where there is ambiguity in intent.

The most depressing aspect of Py3k (for me) is that the stdlib is not
being reorganized, but this does mean that most existing modules will
still be in the same place!
