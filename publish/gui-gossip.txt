GUI Gossip
==========

Tkinter

 - fairly primitive;
 - but: comes with every Python install!
 - still a bit immature (feb 2007) for Mac OS X native ("Aqua"); X11 version
   works fine on OS X.


PyQT (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)

 - mature;
 - cross platform;
 - freely available for Open Source Software use;
 - has a testing framework!

KWWidgets (http://www.kwwidgets.org/)

 - immature; based on Tk, so Mac OS X native is still a bit weak;
 - lightweight;
 - attractive;
 - has a testing framework!

pyFLTK (http://sf.net/projects/pyfltk/)

 - cross platform;
 - FLTK is mature, although primitive;
 - not very pretty;
 - very lightweight;

wxWindows (http://www.wxwindows.org/)

 - cross platform;
 - mature?; looks good.
 - no personal or "friend" experience;
 - try reading http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-wxwin.html

pyGTK (http://www.pygtk.org/)

 - cross platform;
 - mature; looks good.
 - no personal or "friend" experience;
 - UI designer;

Mild recommendation: start with Qt, which is apparently very mature
and very powerful.
