Tools to Help You Work
======================

IPython
-------

`IPython <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/About>`__ is an interactive
interpreter that aims to be a very convenient shell for working with
Python.

Features of note:

 - Tab completion
 - ? and ?? help
 - history
 - CTRL-P search (in addition to standard CTRL-R/emacs)
 - use an editor to write stuff, and export stuff into an edtor
 - colored exception tracebacks
 - automatic function/parameter call stuff
 - auto-quoting with ','
 - 'run' (similar to execfile) but with -n, -i

See `Quick tips <http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node4.html>`__ for
even more of a laundry list!

screen and VNC
--------------

screen is a non-graphical tool for running multiple text windows in a single
login session.

Features:

 - multiple windows w/hotkey switching
 - copy/paste between windows
 - detach/resume

VNC is a (free) graphical tool for persistent X Windows sessions (and
Windows control, too).

To start: ::

  % vncserver

WARNING: Running VNC on an open network is a big security risk!!

Trac
----

Trac is a really nice-looking and friendly project management Web site.
It integrates a Wiki with a version control repository browser, a
ticket management system, and some simple roadmap controls.

In particular, you can:

 - browse the source code repository
 - create tickets
 - link checkin comments to specific tickets, revisions, etc.
 - customize components, permissions, roadmaps, etc.
 - view project status

It integrates well with subversion, which is "a better CVS".
