Idiomatic Python Take 3: new-style classes
==========================================

Someone (Lila) asked me a question about pickling and memory usage
that led me on a chase through google, and along the way I was
reminded that new-style classes do have one or two interesting
points.

You may remember from the first day that there was a brief discussion
of new-style classes.  Basically, they're classes that inherit from
'object' explicitly:

>>> class N(object):
...   pass

and they have a bunch of neat features (covered `here
<http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/>`__ in
detail).  I'm going to talk about two of them: __slots__ and descriptors.

__slots__ are a memory optimization.  As you know, you can assign any
attribute you want to an object:

>>> n = N()
>>> n.test = 'some string'
>>> print n.test
some string

Now, the way this is implemented behind the scenes is that there's a
dictionary hiding in 'n' (called 'n.__dict__') that holds all of the
attributes.  However, dictionaries consume a fair bit of memory above
and beyond their contents, so it might be good to get rid of the dictionary
in some circumstances and specify precisely what attributes a class has.

You can do that by creating a __slots__ entry:

>>> class M(object):
...   __slots__ = ['x', 'y', 'z']

Now objects of type 'M' will contain only enough space to hold those three
attributes, and nothing else.

A side consequence of this is that you can no longer assign to arbitrary
attributes, however!

>>> m = M()
>>> m.x = 5
>>> m.a = 10
Traceback (most recent call last):
 ...
AttributeError: 'M' object has no attribute 'a'

This will look strangely like some kind of type declaration to people
familiar with B&D languages, but I assure you that it is not!  You are
supposed to use __slots__ only for memory optimization...

Speaking of memory optimization (which is what got me onto this in the
first place) apparently using new-style classes and __slots__ both
dramatically decrease memory consumption:

Managed attributes
------------------

Another nifty pair of features in new-style classes are managed
attributes and descriptors.

You may know that in the olden days, you could intercept attribute access
by overwriting __getattr__:

>>> class A:
...    def __getattr__(self, name):
...        if name == 'special':
...           return 5
...        return self.__dict__[name]
>>> a = A()
>>> a.special
5

This turns out to be kind of inefficient, because *every* attribute access
now goes through __getattr__.  Plus, it's a bit ugly and it can lead to
buggy code.

Python 2.2 introduced "managed attributes".  With managed attributes, you
can *define* functions that handle the get, set, and del operations for
an attribute:

>>> class B(object):
...   def _get_special(self):
...       return 5
...   special = property(_get_special)
>>> b = B()
>>> b.special
5

If you wanted to provide a '_set_special' function, you could do some
really bizarre things:

>>> class B(object):
...   def _get_special(self):
...      return 5
...   def _set_special(self, value):
...      print 'ignoring', value
...   special = property(_get_special, _set_special)
>>> b = B()

Now, retrieving the value of the 'special' attribute will give you '5',
no matter what you set it to:

>>> b.special
5
>>> b.special = 10
ignoring 10
>>> b.special
5

Ignoring the array of perverse uses you could apply, this is actually
useful -- for one example, you can now do internal consistency checking
on attributes, intercepting inconsistent values before they actually get
set.

Descriptors
-----------

Descriptors are a related feature that let you implement attribute access
functions in a different way.  First, let's define a read-only descriptor:

>>> class D(object):
...   def __get__(self, obj, type=None):
...      print 'in get:', obj
...      return 6

Now attach it to a class:

>>> class A(object):
...   val = D()

>>> a = A()
>>> a.val				# doctest: +ELLIPSIS
in get: <A object at ...>
6

What happens is that 'a.val' is checked for the presence of a __get__ function,
and if such exists, it is called instead of returning 'val'.  You can also
do this with __set__ and __delete__:

>>> class D(object):
...   def __get__(self, obj, type=None):
...      print 'in get'
...      return 6
...
...   def __set__(self, obj, value):
...      print 'in set:', value
...
...   def __delete__(self, obj):
...      print 'in del'

>>> class A(object):
...   val = D()
>>> a = A()
>>> a.val = 15
in set: 15
>>> del a.val
in del
>>> print a.val
in get
6

This can actually give you control over things like the *types* of objects
that are assigned to particular classes: no mean thing.
