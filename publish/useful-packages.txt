Useful Packages
===============

subprocess
----------

'subprocess' is a new addition (Python 2.4), and it provides a convenient
and powerful way to run system commands.  (...and you should use it instead
of os.system, commands.getstatusoutput, or any of the Popen modules).

Unfortunately subprocess is a bi hard to use at the moment; I'm hoping
to help fix that for Python 2.6, but in the meantime here are some basic
commands.

Let's just try running a system command and retrieving the output:

>>> import subprocess
>>> p = subprocess.Popen(['/bin/echo', 'hello, world'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> (stdout, stderr) = p.communicate()
>>> print stdout,
hello, world

What's going on is that we're starting a subprocess (running
'/bin/echo hello, world') and then asking for all of the output
aggregated together.

We could, for short strings, read directly from p.stdout (which is a file
handle):

>>> p = subprocess.Popen(['/bin/echo', 'hello, world'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> print p.stdout.read(),
hello, world

but you could run into trouble here if the command returns a lot of data;
you should use communicate to get the output instead.

Let's do something a bit more complicated, just to show you that it's
possible: we're going to write to 'cat' (which is basically an echo chamber):

>>> from subprocess import PIPE
>>> p = subprocess.Popen(["/bin/cat"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE)
>>> (stdout, stderr) = p.communicate('hello, world')
>>> print stdout,
hello, world

There are a number of more complicated things you can do with subprocess --
like interact with the stdin and stdout of other processes -- but they
are fraught with peril.

rpy
---

`rpy <http://rpy.sf.net/>`__ is an extension for R that lets R and
Python talk naturally.  For those of you that have never used R, it's
a very nice package that's mainly used for statistics, and it has *tons*
of libraries.

To use rpy, just ::

   from rpy import *

The most important symbol that will be imported is 'r', which lets you
run arbitrary R comments: ::

   r("command")

For example, if you wanted to run a principle component analysis, you could
do it like so: ::

   from rpy import *
   
   def plot_pca(filename):
       r("""data <- read.delim('%s', header=FALSE, sep=" ", nrows=5000)""" \
         % (filename,))
   
       r("""pca <- prcomp(data, scale=FALSE, center=FALSE)""")
       r("""pairs(pca$x[,1:3], pch=20)""")
   
   plot_pca('vectors.txt')

Now, the problem with this code is that I'm really just using Python to 
drive R, which seems inefficient.  You *can* go access the data directly
if you want; I'm just using R's loading features directly because they're
faster.  For example,

   x = r.pca['x']

is equivalent to 'x <- pca$x'.

matplotlib
----------

`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sf.net>`__ is a plotting package that
aims to make "simple things easy, and hard things possible".  It's got
a fair amount of matlab compatibility if you're into that.

Simple example: ::

   x = [ i**2 for i in range(0, 500) ]
   hist(x, 100)
