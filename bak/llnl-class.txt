========================================================
Intermediate and Advanced Software Carpentry with Python
========================================================

Outline
=======

Three days: plan for three hours instruction, three hours hands-on, plus
breaks.

Day 1
-----

Goal: Ensure that participants understand how to build re-usable Python
      code & design for re-use and maintenance.

Straight Python:

 * building Python programs and laying out packages
 * writing for reusability
 * maintaining Python codebases & testing
 * advanced features of the Python language
 * a brief intro to extending Python with C/C++

This day will be devoted to exploring people's knowledge about Python,
and can be adjusted dynamically to provide more basic or more advanced
information.

Day 2
-----

Goal: Introduce participants to the variety of (excellent!) tools for
      working with Python, esp in science.

Tools

 * Wrapping C/C++ code automatically
 * NumPy/SciPy
 * Rpy, matplotlib: tools for plotting
 * UNIX tools to help you develop and collaborate: screen, VNC
 * IDLE/IDEs
 * Centralized and distributed version control 
 * Trac project management
 * IPython interactive Python interpreter

This day will explore the variety of tools for effectively working
with and reaching out from Python.

Day 3
-----

Goal: Provide hands-on experience with automatically producing static
      and interactive views of your data and analysis results.

Databases, data analysis, and data presentation

 * Storing data in a structured manner
 * Built-in Python options (shelve/bsddb)
 * Using SQL
     - SQLite
     - MySQL/PostgreSQL
 * Building static HTML output
 * Building dynamic HTML output with CGI/CherryPy
 * Tying the database into your Web server
 * Testing your Web stuff

This day will introduce people to effective techniques for data storage
and presentation with Python.

(A whole day might be needed because of the variety of topics: both
HTML and SQL must be introduced!)

The menu of topics
===================

Building reusable code:

 - modules, globals vs locals, import issues
 - PYTHONPATH
 - building/installing packages: distutils, easy_install, 'require'

Testing

 - doctests, unittests, test fixtures
 - more advanced unit testing tools: nose/py.test
 - code coverage/figleaf

Simple database stuff
 
 - pickling
 - bsddb/shelve
 - SQL, sqlite, and MySQL/PostgreSQL
 - Durus/ZODB: object databases

Docstrings and automatic generation of documentation

Building Python interfaces to C and C++ code

 - writing simple interfaces manually is easy
 - SWIG, Boost.Python, SIP: examples & tradeoffs
 - 
 - testing C code from Python

Java/Jython

.NET/Mono/IronPython

NumPy/SciPy

matplotlib, a matlib-type Python graphing/display system

Rpy, Python interface to R

Generators, iterators, yield, list/generator comprehensions

The lesser known (but useful!) corners of the Python stdlib 

File management and APIs: how to deal nicely with paths, data files,
  etc.

Using subprocess to flexibly execute external programs.

IPython interactive Python prompt

Another way to develop: scripting with two windows

XML parsing

Generating HTML for analysis summary and presentation

The logging package: logging and py.logging

Python interfaces to MPI

Concurrency and threading in Python: threading vs fork vs...; the
   Global Interpreter Lock

py.lib sshexec, a flexible way to run programs on multiple computers

How Python is developed and how to think about backwards/forwards compatibility

IDEs: IDLE

Building simple Web servers (with CherryPy, probably?  Or CGI.)

A brief introduction to GUI development in Python.

UNIX tricks: screen, VNC

pdb, the Python debugger

Building your own types: using dicts and lists as interfaces to your own
   data; advanced dictionary use.

Version control with subversion, darcs, bzr-ng

Project, ticket, and timeline management with Trac.
